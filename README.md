Made a fun Rock, Paper, and Scissors game using Microsoft Visual Studio (2022) and C#. The goal was to create an enjoyable gaming experience with the classic game rules. The game shows buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors, and users can pick their choices. When they click a button, the computer randomly picks its choice, and we reveal the result. To make it more exciting, the user's choice is hidden first and then shown on the screen.
.  Game Mechanics: We used a simple approach to design the game's look with Windows Forms. When users click a button for their choice, the code reacts to that action. We used a trick to randomly pick the computer's choice, and then we compared both choices to find the winner. The game result appears on the screen through separate labels, making it interactive and smooth.
